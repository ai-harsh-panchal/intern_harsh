Prepare an example which demonstrates the use of normal model, abstract model and the transient models.

Normal Model
-Usage: It is used to create standard models that persistently store data in the database.
- Example:
    - You are building a module for a school management system.
    - You create models like `Student`, `Faculty`, and `Course` to store information about students, faculty members, and courses.
    - Example data stored:
        - `Student`: Name, Age, Class, Roll Number.
        - `Faculty`: Name, Subject, Department.

2. Abstract Model
- Usage: These are base models used for sharing common fields and logic across different models without storing data directly.
- Example:
    - In the school management system, both `Student` and `Faculty` should have a "contact details" section (fields like `email` and `phone`).
    - Instead of duplicating these fields in `Student` and `Faculty`, you create an `Abstract Model` that contains these reusable fields and logic.
    - Both `Student` and `Faculty` models inherit this abstract model.

3. Transient Model
-Usage: These are temporary models that are used to handle data for wizards or temporary forms. The data is cleared after execution or after some time.
-Example:
    - You create a wizard to assign multiple students to a course. This wizard collects input (e.g., course name and student list) temporarily, executes the operation, and then discards the data.
    - Transient models are also used for filters, report parameters, or user input forms in the system.
